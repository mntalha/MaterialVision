# MaterialVision: Matching Materials Science Prompts with STEM Images

MaterialVision is an innovative project that bridges the gap between textual descriptions of materials and their visual representations through STEM (Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy) imaging. The project employs Vision Transformers to establish connections between materials science prompts and their corresponding atomic-scale images.

## Project Overview

This project combines three key elements:
1. Materials Science knowledge representation
2. STEM image simulation and analysis
3. Vision Transformer-based matching algorithms

### Key Features

#### 1. STEM Image Processing
- Generation of STEM simulations from atomic structures
- Image processing and enhancement
- Feature extraction from atomic-scale images

#### 2. Text-Image Matching
- Processing of materials science prompts
- Correlation between textual descriptions and image features
- Semantic understanding of materials properties

#### 3. Vision Transformer Implementation
- Advanced image analysis capabilities
- Multi-modal learning (text and image)
- Structure-property relationship understanding

```

2. **STEM Image Generation**
```python
from jarvis.analysis.stem.convolution_apprx import STEMConv
from jarvis.core.atoms import Atoms

# Generate STEM image from atomic structure
stem_sim = STEMConv(output_size=[200, 200])
stem_image = stem_sim.simulate_surface(atoms=structure)[0]
```
